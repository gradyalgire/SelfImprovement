                    <h2>Don't Believe Everything You Think: Why Your Thinking Is The Beginning & End Of Suffering - Joseph Nguyen</h2><br>
                    <p>This book is a practical guide that helps you understand how your thoughts shape your emotional experience and overall well-being. It teaches that the stories your mind creates are not objective truth, and that much of your suffering comes from unexamined thinking patterns rather than actual events. The book offers clear explanations of how thoughts influence emotions, behaviors, and habits, and it provides tools to notice, question, and change unhelpful thinking. By learning to separate your identity from your thoughts, you gain emotional clarity, reduce anxiety and self-criticism, and make room for healthier beliefs. This supports self-healing and improvement by encouraging mindful awareness, emotional regulation, and intentional reframing so you can respond to life with greater peace, perspective, and purpose.</p>

                    <h2>It took me 3 years to beat overthinking. I'll tell you how to in 5 steps - Clark Kegley</h2><br>
                    <p>This video is about breaking free from overthinking and finally taking action. It explains why thinking more doesn't solve the problem, and why doing something, even if it's small or imperfect, is what actually creates change. You'll learn how to slow your mind, stop putting pressure on yourself to be perfect, and build confidence by taking simple steps forward. If you feel stuck in your head, afraid to start, or overwhelmed by trying to do everything “right,” this video shows you how to move forward anyway.</p>

                    <h2>The Pursuit Of Happyness - Gabriele Muccino</h2><br>
                    <p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a grounded reminder that progress is built through persistence, not luck. It shows what happens when discipline replaces excuses and commitment outlasts comfort. The film challenges you to take responsibility under pressure, keep moving when results are invisible, and protect your belief in yourself even when circumstances offer no reassurance. It's not about shortcuts or motivation. It's about showing up every day, doing the work, and earning a better future step by step.</p>

                    <h2>Beautiful Boy - Felix Van Groeningen</h2><br>
                    <p>Beautiful Boy is a portrayal of addiction. The film focuses on the long, uneven reality of recovery, relapse, accountability, and the strain that addiction places on both the individual and the people who care about them. It does not romanticize suffering or promise quick healing. Instead, it reinforces a hard truth: improvement is possible, but it requires patience, honesty, and sustained effort over time. This is not a motivational film. It is a realistic one, meant to build awareness, responsibility, and respect for the work real change demands.</p>
                    <p><strong>Triggers:</strong> drug addiction, relapse, family distress.</p>
